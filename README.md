# Technology Radar
The Technology Radar is an overview of different technologies - from languages, frameworks, tools, and patterns to platforms.
Technologies in the TechRadar are organized into four quadrants, and then into four rings. The quadrants represent different categories of technologies, while the rings reflect their level of adoption.

#### The quadrants are:
* **Languages & Frameworks:** We've placed development languages (such as Java or Python) here, as well as more low-level development frameworks (such as SpringBoot or Hibernate), which are useful for implementing custom software of all kinds.
* **Tools:** Here we put different software tools - from small helpers to bigger software projects
* **Platforms & Services:** This quadrant clusters technologies around the operation of software and infrastructure-related platforms, tools, and services.
* **Methods & Patterns:** Here we put information on methods and patterns concerning development, continuous x, testing, organization, architecture, etc.

#### Each of the element is classified in one of these rings:
* **ADOPT:** We have experience and trust in this technology. There is no doubt that it is proven and mature for use. For a particular use case, we see this as the best choice.
* **TRIAL:** Recommended for use on a trial basis. Not completely proven. More experience is needed.
* **ASSESS:** We see a lot of potential in this technology, but it needs more research and validation.
* **HOLD:** Avoid if possible. Flawed or not mature enough. There are better alternatives now.

## User Stories
1. For all users, it's Read-Only - they only see radars, can filter and hover or click to get more information - **â€œhttps:BYOTR/RO"**
2. Secondly, there are Read-Write-specific users who can see the radars, filter, hover over or click to get more information, edit or delete any element, and create a new radar using **"https:BYOTR/RW"** as the URL.
